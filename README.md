# TroopTrack
An android app to keep track of the user's health conditions and physical location.

# Description -

This app was built to provide an user interface for the main project which was made using MSP430 microcontroller . This app is just the UI which displays the readings provided by the microcontroller . The reading comprises of - Heart beat , Temperature (Body and Surroundings) , Pir sensor status , Gps location and Emergency status (if it arises ) . This app has a built-in feature wherein , the values get updated by simply shaking the phone . The user can check the location of the device by opening the map interface provided . It also features some additional info - product demonstration and component list that were used in the making of the product .


The login Screen and the user interface is as shown -
